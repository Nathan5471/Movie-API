# Movie API

## Description

This API allows you to add and remove movies based on their TVDB ID. If you are logged in, you can edit your movies and add ratings to any movies. If you aren't logged in, you can see movies and see the ratings.

## Technologies

This API was made using Express JS and Node.js. For auth I used JWT and MongoDB was used for the backend. It is documented using Swagger (Open API), you can see this documentation at <https://movieapi.nathanc.me/api-docs>
